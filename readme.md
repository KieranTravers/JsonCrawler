Understanding Errors and Outputs
When analyzing JSON files, AntJournal meticulously scans for and reports any irregularities or issues. Here are some common errors you might encounter:

'field' is null: Indicates a null value for 'field'. Nulls might be intentional or represent missing data, but they can also disrupt data uniformity and processing.

Inconsistent types for 'field': Highlights when values under the same field across different objects have varying data types. Uniform data types are crucial for consistent data processing and analysis.

Sample Error Output:
If you run AntJournal with a JSON file that has inconsistencies or issues, you might see output like this:

```bash
Errors found in JSON file:
 - Item 2: 'website' is null
 - Item 3: 'contact_number' is null
 - Inconsistent types for 'name': {'str', 'int'}
 - Inconsistent types for 'id': {'str', 'int'}
 - Inconsistent types for 'website': {'str', 'NoneType'}
 - Inconsistent types for 'contact_number': {'str', 'NoneType'}
```

This detailed reporting helps you understand exactly what needs attention, allowing for precise corrections and consistency in your JSON data.
